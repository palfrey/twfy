<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/01/17/6-days-to-stop-mps-concealing-their-expenses/">To read more background to mysociety&rsquo;s position, read this Blog post.</a> Suggestions for some things you could say:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask them to vote against the draft Freedom of Information (Parliament) Order 2009
this Thursday. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfoi.org.uk/pdf/FOI%28Parliament%29Order2009.pdf">The
Order and Explanatory Memorandum (PDF)</a>)

<li>Ask them to sign Jo Swinson&rsquo;s Early Day Motion (<a target="_blank" href="http://joswinson.org.uk/news/000818/expen
ses_move_risks_further_tarnishing_parliament__swinson.html">details on Jo Swinson&rsquo;s site</a>)

<li>Don&rsquo;t assume your MP is against releasing expenses information &ndash;
<ul>
<li>This measure was introduced quietly at the last minute;
<li>Your message may be the first they&rsquo;ve heard of it;
<li>Many MPs are strongly in favour of greater transparency;
<li>Above all, and as ever, <em>be polite</em>.
</ul>

<li>Let them know that you want Parliament to be more open, not less, and that
this is the wrong direction of travel.

<li>Tell them that TheyWorkForYou will prominently
display whether or not they vote for or against this order, and that
both voting for and abstention will be noted as a vote against greater transparency.

<li>Ask them whether they&rsquo;d think it was acceptable if other public
servants didn&rsquo;t have to account for their expenses.
		
<!-- <li>Once you&rsquo;re done, blog about it, call a local newspaper (find one here), text, email, and instant
message your friends to let them know that about this campaign. -->

</ul>
