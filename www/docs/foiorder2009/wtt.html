* Ask them to vote against the draft Freedom of Information (Parliament) Order 2009
this Thursday.

[The page should include a link/reference to the measure for inclusion]

* Ask them to sign the Jo Swinson's Early Day Motion

* Don't assume your MP is against releasing expenses information -
    * This measure was introduced quietly at the last minute
        * your message may be the first they've heard of it.
	    * many MPs are strongly in favour of greater transparency
	        * above all, and as ever, BE POLITE.
		
		* Let them know that you want Parliament to be more open, not less,
		and that this is the wrong direction of travel.
		* Tell them that TheyWorkForYou will prominently
		display whether or not they vote for or against this order, and that
		both voting for and abstention will be noted as a vote against greater transparency.
		* Ask them whether they'd think it was acceptable if other public
		servants didn't have to account for their expenses.
		
		* Once you're done, blog about it, call a local newspaper(find one here), text, email, and instant
		message your friends to let them know that about this campaign.
