<p>On the 16th of May 2008 the High Court ruled that MPs&rsquo; expenses must be published under the Freedom of Information Act.

<p>Tomorrow, <strong>MPs are voting to change the law to keep their expenses secret</strong> after all,
just before publication was due and after spending nearly a million of your pounds and seven months
compiling the data.

<p>In yesterday&rsquo;s inauguration speech, President Obama said: <em>&ldquo;And
those of us who manage the public&rsquo;s dollars will be held to account - to
spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -
because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their
government.&rdquo;</em> It is time to tell our politicians that this is the attitude
we&rsquo;re looking for in our leaders.</p>

<p>The outcome of this vote will be <strong>prominently displayed on every MP&rsquo;s page</strong>, where millions will see it, until after the next General Election.
