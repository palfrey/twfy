<p>On the 16th of May 2008 the High Court ruled that MPs&rsquo; expenses must be published under the Freedom of Information Act.

<p>This Thursday, <strong>MPs are voting to change the law to keep their expenses secret</strong> after all,
just before publication was due and after spending nearly a million of your pounds and seven months
compiling the data.

<p>Your MP <strong>may not even know about this proposal</strong> (it was sneaked out under
the Heathrow runway announcement). Please take a few minutes to alert
them to this attack on Parliamentary transparency and ask them to vote
against the measure.

<p>The outcome of this vote will be <strong>prominently displayed on every MP&rsquo;s page</strong> until after the next General Election.

<h3>What can you do?</h3>
