video_status column, hansard table
==================================

This bitfield documents the status of video with respect to the speech.

Bit 0 = according to the bbcparlvid database and Hansard's timestamp, there is video for this speech.
Bit 1 = CaptionBot has a timestamp for this speech.
Bit 2 = Someone has timestamped this speech, yay.
Bit 3 = There is no video for this speech, no matter what the above lot say.

0,2	No video
1,3	Video, needs timestamping
4,6	Impossible (hopefully!)
5,7	Timestamped by user
8+	No video available, manual override

video_timestamps table
======================

user_id is currently -1 for CaptionBot, NULL for anonymous, or the user's user_id.
(Might change this at some point to be 0 for anonymous to make the queries simpler.)

deleted is set to 1 if the user clicks Oops (or lets us know that the video is wrong).
If you mark a timestamp as deleted, you'll need to update the video_status column as
above (generally AND with 11 to remove the setting of bit 2).
