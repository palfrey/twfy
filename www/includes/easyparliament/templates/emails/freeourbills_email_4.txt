Subject: Free Our Bills Action Email: Please Write To Your MP about the new Speaker

Hello Free Our Bills Supporters,

You might have noticed that despite 140 MPs signing up to our campaign, and
over 4000 people joining our list that Free Our Bills hasn't yet succeeded
in getting Parliament to publish Bills in a 21st century manner.

However, if you were watching the news really carefully recently, you might
have spotted a few changes happening in Westminster :)

As a consequence, we've now written to most of the MPs who are most likely to
stand for election as the new Speaker of the House of Commons to ask them to
endorse three principles that we think are super important:

The second of these principles is endorsement of Free Our Bills. Which is
going to be important, because we know the new Speaker's going to face some
real obstructions to reform <http://tinyurl.com/pllj6k>. The first possible
candidate has already written back to say they're broadly supportive: we'll be
putting all responses on the MP's own page on TheyWorkForYou.com.  And,
funnily, a *lot* of people seem to have been studying their MPs on
TheyWorkForYou, of late.


*You can make the difference!*

*Please write to your MP right now*

Tell them (politely, as always) that they should *only* vote for a candidate
who has gone on the record as endorsing the principles found here.

Let them know why better bills matter to you in particular, and what you can't
do today that you'd like to be able to (alerts, comparisons, annotations etc
etc).

You can do it! Follow this link to write to your own MP.

Please do let us know what your MP says back to you about it, too.

many thanks,

Tom
