Subject: Ask your MP to sign EDM 2141 to help TheyWorkForYou

Hello there!

Today we just want you to do one thing to help TheyWorkForYou's
campaign to get Parliament to publish bills in a better way, if
you'd be so kind.

Please go to http://www.writetothem.com/?a=westminstermp and ask
your MP to sign Early Day Motion (EDM) 2141 

The more MPs that sign the more the house authorities will
realise how this is an issue of wide public interest, and that
there are thousands of people behind Free Our Bills. You can
read the EDM at http://tinyurl.com/629m5n

Thanks very much, and do let us know if your MP replies with
anything interesting!

all the best,

Tom Steinberg and the whole mySociety team

The Free Our Bills campaign is mySociety's attempt to get
Parliament to publish bills in a better way. In particular it
will allow mySociety (and anyone else) to develop new systems to
allow you to:

* Sign up to get notified by email when a keyword you care about
appears in a bill or an amendment

* Compare different versions of bills quickly and easily

* See how amendments would change bills without spending hours waving
around different bits of paper

* Many more things that newspapers, individuals, politicians and
enthusiastic amateurs can do with good quality data that we haven't
thought of yet.

If you don't want to be in the campaign and get updates any
more, please reply to this email with the subject
"unsubscribe" and we'll remove you.
