Subject: Your MP isn't supporting Free Our Bills yet - you can persuade them!

Hello there!

We've got some good news and some bad re. Free Our Bills,
TheyWorkForYou's campaign to give us the chance to find, read and
discuss the next batch of laws, before they become law.

The good news is that over 100 MPs have now signed our Early Day
Motion, asking the House of Commons to get off it's arse and
start publishing bills in a manner suitable for the 21st century.

The bad news it that as of today YOUR MP, $MP_NAME, hasn't 
signed yet! Please let them know what you think about this
by dropping them a mail via the following link:

We need as many MPs to sign this motion as possible so that the
house authorities who don't understand why this campaign could
possibly matter are forced to look at the issue seriously.

If you can't remember why you signed up to this campaign, or why
you should bother your MP, just remember - without it you won't
ever:

    1. Get sent emails when a word or phrase of interest to you
    comes up in a bill - although if you want this you might
    like to know some officials think you're being naive! (see
    'bonus tidbit' below).

    2. See how one version of a bill is different from another

    3. See how a bill would look different if an amendment was
    approved

    4. See how pre-existing law would look after a proposed bill
    was passed.

    5. Discuss, share and annotate and part of any bill for
    increased clarity and understanding all round

You may well be able to think of lots of other uses for better
bills yourself - if so, feel free to tell your MP. But whatever
you choose, get writing!

Bonus tidbit:

The view of one senior unelected official about email alerts for
new bills is that:

    "Given the vocabulary currently used in legislative
    drafting, and the probablity that this would produce a huge
    amount of dross, I think this is naive. If we wanted to do
    it, we could.  But do we want to do it?"

Sorry Roger - 73,649 email alerts on TheyWorkForYou so far
suggest you're wrong. And, oh yes, please don't call our
supporters naive...
