Subject: Your MP isn't supporting Free Our Bills yet - make them sign EDM 2141!

Hello there!

We've got some good news and bad news about Free Our Bills.

The good news is that over 100 MPs have now signed our Early Day
Motion number 2141, asking the House of Commons to get off
its arse and start publishing bills in a manner suitable
for the 21st century.

The bad news is that as of last night YOUR MP, <?=$values['mp_name']?>, 
hasn't signed yet! Please ask them to sign by dropping them
a mail via the following link:

We need as many MPs to sign this motion as possible so that the
House authorities who don't understand why this campaign could
possibly matter are forced to look at the issue seriously.

We've written some hot tips to help you persuade your MP to
come on board, it's all on the letter page.

Bonus tidbit:

We've obtained an internal email from Parliament where one
senior unelected official muses on the merits of letting
people sign up to email alerts for words and phrases
in new bills:

"Given the vocabulary currently used in legislative
drafting, and the probablity that this would produce a huge
amount of dross, I think this is naive. If we wanted to do
it, we could.  But do we want to do it?"

Sorry Mr. Rogers - 73,649 email alerts on TheyWorkForYou so
far suggest you're wrong, as do the thousands of supporters
of Free Our Bills. And, oh yes, please don't call our
supporters naive...
