Subject: Platypus jail-break update from TheyWorkForYou

Hello Free Our Bills Supporters!

We just wanted to give you a quick update on how things are
going with the Free Our Bills campaign.

The first thing to say is that we've had a fantastic level of support
from senior politicians.

The campaign was immediately and publicly endorsed by David
Cameron and Nick Clegg and the Leader of the House Harriet
Harman has started asking officials in the Commons to
explore the issue. You can read about or watch the
endorsements here:
http://www.mysociety.org/2008/03/25/the-free-our-bills-campaign-launches/

We're now awaiting an update from Parliament to find out
what the nature of the (inevitable) objections from some of
the less enthusiastic unelected Parliamentary officials are
- we've already seen some quite remarkably strident
opposition in a Freedom of Information request. We will work
to explain in as clear and straightforward way possible why
what we're asking for doesn't compromise Parliamentary
neutrality, why it won't upset workflow, and why over a
thousand of you want the services that can only be delivered
if Parliament makes this small change.

Meanwhile, we'd like to return the favour for supporting our
campaign by giving you first look at some new features on
www.TheyWorkForYou.com

1. Scottish Parliament debates, written questions and MSP pages are
now available on www.TheyWorkForYou.com , built by our
Edinburgh based volunteer Mark Longair ( http://longair.net/mark/ ). 
Thanks Mark!

2. Vastly improved Hansard search, including ability to search by date
range, party, department and more. It even corrects your spelling
if you mistype a query.

We've got more goodies in store, and we'll be rolling them out as the
campaign goes along.

all the best,

Tom Steinberg
