We're now using 1.0.5 of Xapian. This has Debian binaries, so was simply
installed using apt-get. The same goes for the PHP bindings.

Search::Xapian was a little trickier; trying to use dh-make-perl to
create a Debian binary from the CPAN module failed with an error. It turns
out that dh-make-perl uses Module::Depends::Intrusive to work out the
dependencies of a module, which in turn runs the Makefile.PL but captures
the output - the Makefile.PL for Search::Xapian tries to open the created
Makefile in order to check version numbering and more, so this doesn't work
as the Makefile isn't there. Commenting out the post-Makefile checks (after
manually checking they're okay!) lets it all work fine and build the binary.
